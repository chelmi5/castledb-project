Parsing level data from CastleDB to use with Flambe &amp; Haxe

Started as a project to work on at my internship, I wanted to figure out how ncannasse's CastleDB level editor worked and get it loading into a Haxe/Flambe project. At present, it can load the ground, objects, and over layers on the sample map provided on the website, including the Borders in Ground mode.

CastleDB can be found here: http://castledb.org/
